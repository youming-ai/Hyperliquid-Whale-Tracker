# Implementation Plan: HyperDash Platform

**Branch**: `001-hyperdash-platform` | **Date**: 2025-01-18 | **Spec**: [specs/001-hyperdash-platform/spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-hyperdash-platform/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

HyperDash is a comprehensive data intelligence and copy trading platform for Hyperliquid derivatives ecosystem. The platform provides real-time market analytics (liquidation heatmaps, top traders, live feeds) and enables strategic copy trading with risk management. Technical approach includes: Next.js frontend with real-time WebSocket streaming, Kafka/Redpanda event streaming architecture, ClickHouse for time-series analytics, PostgreSQL for transactional data, and a high-performance copy trading engine with sub-second execution latency targets.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/Node.js, Next.js 14, Go/Rust for performance-critical services  
**Primary Dependencies**: tRPC, Drizzle ORM, Kafka/Redpanda, ClickHouse, Redis, Flink, WebSocket, shadcn/ui  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (transactional), ClickHouse (time-series analytics), Redis (caching)  
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, integration testing with Docker Compose  
**Target Platform**: Web application with Kubernetes deployment  
**Project Type**: web (full-stack application with microservices)  
**Performance Goals**: Market data latency P95 ≤ 1.5s, copy trade execution P95 ≤ 1.0s, support 3k+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: Real-time data processing, sub-second trading execution, high availability (99.9% uptime)  
**Scale/Scope**: 3k+ DAU, 800+ copy trading accounts, 50-100 symbols tracked, 10-30k messages/sec processing

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Constitution Compliance Assessment

**✅ Real-time Monitoring**: Platform implements 1-second market data scanning with WebSocket streaming and asynchronous processing
**✅ Reliable Error Handling**: All external API calls include exponential backoff retry with max 3 attempts 
**✅ Configuration-Driven**: All operational parameters configurable via environment variables with startup validation
**✅ Performance & Observability**: Sub-second execution targets with structured logging and monitoring
**⚠️ Technology Stack Expansion**: Adding TypeScript/Next.js/Go alongside existing Python stack (requires justification)
**⚠️ Complexity Increase**: Microservices architecture with Kafka/ClickHouse vs simple bot (requires justification)

### Gate Violations Requiring Justification

1. **Technology Stack Expansion**: Constitution focused on Python bot, but HyperDash requires TypeScript/Next.js for modern web UI and Go/Rust for performance-critical trading engine. This expansion is necessary because:
   - Web application requires modern frontend framework (Next.js) for real-time dashboards
   - Trading execution engine needs Go/Rust performance for sub-second latency requirements
   - Python remains for data processing and analytics components

2. **Architecture Complexity**: Constitution assumes simple bot architecture, but HyperDash needs microservices with event streaming because:
   - Real-time market data processing at 10-30k msg/s requires streaming architecture
   - Separation of concerns between web UI, analytics, and trading execution
   - Scalability requirements for 3k+ concurrent users

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASSED with documented justifications

**Phase 0 Complete**: Research completed for all technology decisions. See [research.md](research.md) for detailed findings.

**Phase 1 Complete**: Data models, API contracts, and quickstart guide generated. See:
- [data-model.md](data-model.md) - Complete PostgreSQL and ClickHouse schema definitions
- [contracts/openapi.yaml](contracts/openapi.yaml) - Comprehensive API specification
- [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) - Development and deployment guide

**Structure Decision**: Monorepo with clear separation between web frontend, backend microservices, and shared packages. Supports independent deployment and scaling while maintaining code organization.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Technology Stack Expansion | Web application requires modern frontend (Next.js) and high-performance trading engine (Go/Rust) | Single Python stack cannot meet sub-second trading latency requirements and modern web UX expectations |
| Microservices Architecture | Real-time data processing at 10-30k msg/s with separation of concerns (analytics, trading, web UI) | Monolithic architecture cannot scale to handle 3k+ concurrent users with varying performance requirements |
| Event Streaming with Kafka | Reliable processing of high-volume market data with exactly-once semantics | Simple message queues cannot handle throughput and guarantee delivery requirements |
| Multiple Database Systems | PostgreSQL for ACID transactions (trading, billing), ClickHouse for time-series analytics (market data) | Single database cannot optimize for both transactional and analytical workloads at required scale |
