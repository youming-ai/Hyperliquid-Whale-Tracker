- **Analytics Database**: ClickHouse with specialized financial time-series schema design
- **Trading Engine**: Go over Rust for optimal balance of performance and development velocity
- **Exchange Integration**: Comprehensive Hyperliquid API integration with WebSocket support

## Technology Stack Decisions

### 1. Frontend Technology Stack: Next.js + TypeScript

**Decision**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components

**Rationale**:
- Modern React framework with App Router for optimal performance
- TypeScript provides type safety across the full stack
- Extensive ecosystem for real-time data visualization
- Strong support for WebSocket integration and server-sent events
- Component reusability with shadcn/ui accelerates development

**Key Implementation Patterns**:
- Multi-channel WebSocket manager with connection pooling
- Hybrid state management: Zustand (real-time UI) + TanStack Query (server state)
- Component memoization and virtualization for high-frequency updates
- Fixed-size lists for handling large datasets
- Debounced UI updates to prevent excessive re-renders

**Alternatives Considered**: React with CRA (less performant), Vue.js (smaller ecosystem), Angular (overly complex for requirements)

### 2. Streaming Platform: Redpanda vs Kafka

**Decision**: Redpanda for streaming platform

**Rationale**:
- 2-10x better throughput for 10-30k messages/sec requirements
- P99 latency of 1-5ms vs 5-20ms for Kafka (critical for trading)
- Single binary deployment eliminates ZooKeeper complexity
- 40% lower cloud infrastructure costs
- Full Kafka API compatibility ensures ecosystem support

**Performance Benefits**:
- Consistent tail latency crucial for trading applications
- C++ implementation eliminates JVM garbage collection pauses
- Faster broker startup and recovery for high availability
- More efficient handling of hot partitions in trading scenarios

**Alternatives Considered**: Apache Kafka (mature ecosystem but higher operational complexity), NATS (less feature-rich for analytics integration)

### 3. Analytics Database: ClickHouse Schema Design

**Decision**: ClickHouse with specialized financial time-series schema design

**Rationale**:
- Purpose-built for analytical queries on time-series data
- Superior compression for financial data types (Gorilla codec for prices)
- Real-time materialized views for KPI calculations
- Proven performance in high-frequency trading environments

**Key Schema Patterns**:
- Partitioning strategy: `(toYYYYMMDD(timestamp), symbol_hash % 8)` for even distribution
- Specialized codecs: Gorilla for prices, Delta+ZSTD for volumes
- Multi-tier retention: 30 days hot SSD, 1 year warm HDD, 7 years compressed archive
- Real-time aggregations using materialized views for OHLCV and VWAP calculations

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Projections for common query patterns (symbol stats, hourly summaries)
- Adaptive compression increasing with data age
- Optimized ingestion with 8-12 parallel Kafka consumers
- Memory-efficient aggregations for high-cardinality operations

**Alternatives Considered**: TimescaleDB (less performant for high-volume analytics), InfluxDB (limited SQL capabilities), Elasticsearch (higher cost for time-series data)

### 4. Trading Execution Engine: Go vs Rust

**Decision**: Go for trading execution engine

**Rationale**:
- More than adequate performance for P95 ≤ 1.0s requirements
- Superior development velocity and code maintainability
- Mature ecosystem with production financial services adoption
- Excellent networking capabilities and concurrency patterns
- Faster iteration cycles for complex trading logic

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Sub-millisecond latency for trading operations (within requirements)
- Predictable garbage collection with minimal latency impact
- Efficient goroutine scheduling for concurrent order processing
- Lower memory footprint compared to JVM-based solutions

**Ecosystem Advantages**:
- Rich library ecosystem for exchange APIs and financial protocols
- Proven track record in high-frequency trading firms
- Easier talent acquisition and team onboarding
- Better integration with existing TypeScript/Node.js stack

**Alternatives Considered**: Rust (superior raw performance but slower development), C++ (maximum performance but high maintenance burden), Java/JVM (adequate performance but higher resource requirements)

### 5. Hyperliquid API Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive API integration with WebSocket streaming and robust error handling

**Current State Analysis**:
- Existing codebase provides basic monitoring with limited REST endpoints
- Critical gaps: no real-time WebSocket connectivity, order management, or authentication
- Current 1-second polling insufficient for copy trading requirements

**Integration Requirements**:
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time market data streaming
- Build comprehensive order management system with multiple execution types
- Design robust error handling with exponential backoff and retry logic
- Implement secure API key management and request signing
- Create scalable architecture supporting 3000+ concurrent users

**Performance Targets**:
- Market data latency: P95 ≤ 500ms
- Order execution: P95 ≤ 1000ms
- Support for 10-30k messages/second processing
- 99.9% uptime availability

## Architecture Complexity Justification

The recommended architecture introduces complexity compared to the current simple bot, but this complexity is necessary and justified:

### Technology Stack Expansion
**Why Needed**: Web application requires modern frontend framework and high-performance trading engine
**Simpler Alternative Rejected**: Single Python stack cannot meet sub-second trading latency requirements and modern web UX expectations

### Microservices Architecture  
**Why Needed**: Real-time data processing at 10-30k msg/s with separation of concerns
**Simpler Alternative Rejected**: Monolithic architecture cannot scale to handle 3k+ concurrent users with varying performance requirements

### Event Streaming with Kafka/Redpanda
**Why Needed**: Reliable processing of high-volume market data with exactly-once semantics
**Simpler Alternative Rejected**: Simple message queues cannot handle throughput and guarantee delivery requirements

### Multiple Database Systems
**Why Needed**: PostgreSQL for ACID transactions, ClickHouse for time-series analytics
**Simpler Alternative Rejected**: Single database cannot optimize for both transactional and analytical workloads at required scale

## Implementation Timeline

Based on the research findings, the recommended implementation timeline is:

**Weeks 1-2**: Infrastructure setup and data ingestion pipeline
- Deploy Redpanda cluster and ClickHouse database
- Implement market data collection service
- Set up Kafka/Redpanda to ClickHouse ingestion pipeline

**Weeks 3-4**: Analytics and real-time processing
